# üìù Blog App Backend

This is a complete backend for a simple blogging platform built with **Node.js**, **Express**, **MongoDB**, and **JWT-based authentication**.  
The backend supports user signup/login, blog creation with image upload, and basic authorization features. Frontend is not completed due to time constraints completing it also with React Js 
and making it responsive. Also I will update multer with aws s3.
